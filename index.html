                <tr>
                    <td>Energetic, hyper, and obsessive-compulsive. She’s the “mother” of the group, and like some mothers, she can be overbearing and domineering. But she can also be the level-headed practical friend, helping others through their irrational moments. Monica is loyal and caring. It’s just the little things, like the slightest mess, that can irk her in a big way.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Funny, affable, sarcastic and a bit insecure. Chandler can always be counted on for a zinger or quip. As he put it, “I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable". Things are always a little more entertaining when Chandler is around, although sometimes his spicy one-liners can be insensitive or annoying to his friends. He means well, though. Probably.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Funny and spirited but pretty self-involved. Rachel was made for the one-percent New York lifestyle, but has a much harder time in the trenches with everyone else. She clearly grew up with people at her beck and call. Life as a "normal" person is proving harder than she thought, but her sense of humor will allow her to at least laugh about it. Still, Rachel is sweet, flexible,and genuine - traits that will likely progress her friendships and, hopefully, career.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Awkward, but not in a bad way. You can almost always count on Ross to do the right thing, and if he fails to, it’s usually because of clumsiness. There’s no alpha-male chest bumping with Ross. He’s more comfortable with a book than a TV remote. Despite his flaws, Ross is genuine, intelligent, selfless, and incredibly funny - whether or not he means to be.</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Eccentric. She embraces her status as “the weird one.” Phoebe doesn’t feel the pressure to conform to anyone’s standards of adulthood. She makes her own rules and encourages civil disobedience whenever necessary. But she’s rarely preachy. More often than not, she simply wants to do her own thing and have fun. She’s truly one of a kind, and that’s just the way she likes it.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Simple, genuine, and fun. It doesn’t take much more than a pizza, a beer, and a football game for Joey to have a good time. While perhaps a bit oblivious at times, and certainly not the brightest knife in the drawer (food reference) Joey is a very loyal companion and is always there to help in his way. Sometimes his, shall we say, “uncomplicated” worldview helps his friends out of their own cluttered headspace.</td>
